class ReportInterviewInteractAction(InterviewInteractAction):
    """Report Interview action is used to create reports.

    This is a concrete implementation of InterviewInteractAction that defines
    a specific interview flow. Sessions are identified by
    interview_type='ReportInterviewInteractAction' and attached to Conversation nodes.

    The question_graph can be overridden in agent.yaml to customize questions.

    Architecture:
        The interview system uses a unified classification and extraction approach
        that detects user intent (CANCELLATION, CONFIRMATION, UPDATE, SUBMISSION, NONE)
        and extracts field values in a single LLM call. All state management and
        directive generation is handled within the main InterviewInteractAction.

    Model Configuration:
        Model settings (model_action_type, model, model_temperature, model_max_tokens,
        use_history, max_statement_length, history_limit) are inherited from
        InterviewInteractAction and can be configured in agent.yaml. These settings
        control the unified classification/extraction LLM call and all directive
        generation prompts.
